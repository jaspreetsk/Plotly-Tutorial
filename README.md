# Learning Plotly for Data Visualization 🚀

I’ve been diving into the world of **Plotly** to enhance my data visualization skills! This repository documents what I’ve learned while exploring Plotly, working in **VSCode** with **WSL2** on **Ubuntu 24 LTS**, and applying various techniques to create **interactive charts and graphs**. 

This journey has been guided by an **excellent YouTube playlist**, where I explored different types of visualizations and experimented with real-world datasets. If you're interested in learning along with me, here’s the playlist:

## Learning Environment 🔧

To get the best experience working with Plotly, I set up the following:
- 🖥️ **Editor:** Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
- 🏗 **Platform:** WSL2 running Ubuntu 24 LTS
- 🐍 **Languages & Tools:** Python with Plotly, and Pandas library

> If you're new to WSL2, check out Microsoft's [WSL2 guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) to get started!

## Data Sources 📊

Throughout my learning process, I used multiple datasets, including both built-in and curated ones:

**First, in the jupyter notebook or in a python shell write these 2 lines of python code:**

```python
    import plotly_express as px
    import pandas as pd
```
**in order to use the below plotly datasets that comes built-in the Plotly Library. The ones starting with px.data._____**

- 📁 **Custom Data:** `sample_data.csv`
- 🔬 **Built-In Plotly Datasets:**
  - `px.data.gapminder()`
  - `px.data.medals_long()`
  - `px.data.stocks()`
  - `px.data.iris()`
  - `px.data.tips()`

Additionally, the **data repository provided by the YouTube playlist creator** was incredibly helpful. You can check it out here:
